## Welcome to Yelp Plus

This an enhanced version of Android Yelp Application with some new features.
It does not have all the features from the original yelp application yet.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Dom07/YelpPlus/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
